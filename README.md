## Installation
1. Make sure that you have already followed the steps described
   in the official documentation:
    - Install `npm` and `react-native-cli`
    - Install Android SDK and `adb`-cli
2. Install `jdk-8.0`. Note that the `gradle` is more compatible 
   with JDK 8. 
3. Check that you have `local.properties` under `android` with 
   Android SDK directory in this file. Note that executing `react-native run-android`
   may still ask for `ANDROID_HOME` even when you have exported 
   this environment variable
4. Make sure that the owner and group of this project are not `root`
